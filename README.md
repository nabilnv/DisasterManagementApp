Welcome to Disaster Management Application
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Demo: https://youtube.com/shorts/TTQ0_Wz4Xqw?feature=share
This project was built using:-
1. IDE - Android Studio
2. Programming Language - Java/Kotlin
3. Database - Firebase
4. API - OpenStreetMap
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Download the project file and open it in Android Studio
Make sure to always do the "Sync With Gradle" option in the File>Sync Project With Gradle Files to ensure the IDE installs all the correct dependencies and gradle build version
If done any changes, make sure to do clean project and build project in Build option at the top of the bar
You were added as editor in Firebase, so you can add/delete/edit any information you need in the firebase and it will be displayed on the application
After open the project, go to firebase>Project Overview (on the left sidebar)>Project Settings>Your Apps (Scroll down to bottom)>download the google-services.json file
Place the .json file in the project directory in Android Studio under the app folder - don't place it anywhere else, a pop-up dialog will show to overwrite the existing .json file, make sure to Overwrite it
This ensure you are integrated with the firebase, although there's already a .json file existed, this acts as a confirmation
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Try to run the app using your physical device rather than emulator for smooth usage of the application
Enable the Developer option in your device ,enable USB Debugging option, connect with Android Studio via QR CODE/Pairing Code
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
You can change the icons/text/or anything related to UI as all the UIs in the application act as a placeholder, you can replace it with your own ones
Same goes to Firebase database, you can create your own hazards to be displayed in the map via the Firebase fields we created, just create a new field and copy all the fields name we created,
in the value sections, add your own value such as coordinates for the hazard to be showed in the application, coordinates to show evacuation routes in the application.
After you add the coordinates for the hazard and entered the type of hazard, the hazard icon based on what hazard you inserted will appear in the map
For example, if you add Flood hazard, flood icon will be appeared automatically in the map
Play with Firebase database, code, and .xml files to get better understanding of what you are dealing with
